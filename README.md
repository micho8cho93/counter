# counter
In counter you need to create an class attendance counter for your teachers. There are two exercises.

# exercises
1) Create a simple counter that gets user input about the class size and then asks the user to record which students are present or absent. The program should then return the total number of present and absent students to the user

2) The more advanced version of counter requires you to also record the names of each student and then ask the user to record whether each student is present or absent. The program should return the total number of present and absent students, and it should also return the names of all present and absent students.

You must add comments explaining how you developed your code and what methods and functions were used at the bottom of your code. If you do not add the explanation, then you will lose points.

# tests
you should be familiar with how to use and run tests to make sure your code is correct, however if you forgot you only need to hit the run button in the top right corner of VScode.
