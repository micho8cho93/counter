"""create functions for counting class attendance based on user input.
example interaction:
    - User inputs: 3
    - User enters: 'y', 'n', 'y'
    - Output: 
      Students present: 2
      Students absent: 1 """

#create your main function called counter

#ask user to input how many students are in the class, remember that input() will read numbers as strings.
# How can we convert the input to an integer? 


#initialize two variables. 
#1) to keep count of students present 
#2) to keep count of students absent



#iterate through number of students and have user input if student is present or absent
#the user inputs 'y' for present and 'n' for absent.
#remember that for loops do not naturally work with integers, how can you iterate through a *range* of numbers?



#print the number of students present and absent        



#run your program
