"""create a class attendance counter that asks for the names of the students
and records their names show if they are present or absent.
 This function:
    - Asks the user for the number of students in the class.
    - Collects student names and stores them in a list.
    - Asks the user to confirm the class list before proceeding.
    - Iterates through the confirmed student list to record attendance.
    - Counts and displays the number of present and absent students along with their names.

    Example interaction:
    - User inputs: 3
    - User enters student names: 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'
    - User confirms list: 'y'
    - User enters attendance: 'y', 'n', 'y'
    - Output:
      Students present: 2
      Student names: ['Alice', 'Charlie']
      Students absent: 1
      Student names: ['Bob']

#create main function called counter


#ask user to input how many students are in the class
#ask the user to input the names of each student based on the number of students in the class. 



#verify that the class list is correct. If the class list is wrong, end the program.
#If the class list is correct then continue with program. This might be a little tricky.
#You should probably use google to figure it out. If you're still stuck, ask for help.     



#initalize 4 variables. 
#2 variables are needed to keep count of the number of students present and absent.
#2 more variables are needed to create a list of student names that are present and absent



#iterate through number and names of students and use user input to record if student is present or absent
#if user input is equal to y then record student as present and add their name to the present list
#if user input is equal to n then record student as absent and add their name to the absent list



#print the number of students present and absent        
#print the names of students present and absent
